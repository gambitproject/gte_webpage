For contributors: GUI project ideas
===================================

These are projects related to the GUI and web interface of GTE.

Enhancements of GUI elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Improved icons, identifying players by colours

* option to swap players easily

* Standard look and feel (termination with `RETURN` key) for
  changing player names; allowing a name for the chance player

* less drastic deletion of subtrees, see https://github.com/gambitproject/gte/issues/11

* improved game tree drawing, see https://github.com/gambitproject/gte/issues/17

* reliable UNDO functionality

* remembering directories for save/load, see https://github.com/gambitproject/gte/issues/13


Port to HTML5/JavaScript
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GTE GUI uses ActionScript for the Flash player, which
does not run on the ipad and iphone.
Port to HTML5/JavaScript can be combined with some code
cleanup.

* **Languages:** ActionScript, JavaScript
* **Prerequisites:**  
  preferably experience in ports from ActionScript to
  JavaScript

Enhancing the web interface with online storage of games
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Web frameworks offer standard functionality of storage of
user data, including user identification via login. 
The project is to create such a framework and webpages to retrieve
typically used games, and store games created by the user. 

Possible extension: Record-keeping and display of results
for computational experiments.
If games are generated systematically with various
parameters, running times and computational results
should be recorded systematically.
