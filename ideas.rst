For contributors: GUI project ideas
===================================

We are applying for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2015,
and have a detailed list of projects at 

http://www.maths.lse.ac.uk/Personal/stengel/gsoc/

The following ideas will be pursued separately.

Enhancing the web interface with online storage of games
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Web frameworks offer standard functionality of storage of
user data, including user identification via login. 
The project is to create such a framework and webpages to retrieve
typically used games, and store games created by the user. 

Possible extension: Record-keeping and display of results
for computational experiments.
If games are generated systematically with various
parameters, running times and computational results
should be recorded systematically.
