The two GTE logos:

	8.fig (square)
	horiz8.fig (horizontal)

are in .fig format, edited with xfig and exported to PDF as

	8.pdf
	horiz8.pdf

where 8.fig is on a 16x16cm layout to ensure it is reasonably well pixelated to a
16x16 icon.

From these .png icons are generated with convert, giving the size in horizonal pixels:

	convert -resize 32 8.pdf 8size32.ico

Similarly, to generate a 16x16 pixel file named  8size16.png

	convert -resize 16 8.pdf 8size16.png

xfig and convert are standard LINUX programs.
