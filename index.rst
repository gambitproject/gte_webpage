Welcome to the homepage for Game Theory Explorer :math:`\beta`, which is a
software tool to create and analyze games as models of strategic interaction.
An extensive or strategic-form game can be created and nicely displayed with a
graphical user interface in a web browser. State-of-the-art algorithms then
compute one or all Nash equilibria of the game.
