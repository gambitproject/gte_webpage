Welcome to the homepage for Game Theory Explorer |beta|, which is a
software tool to create and analyze games as models of strategic interaction.
An extensive or strategic-form game can be created and nicely displayed with a
graphical user interface in a web browser. State-of-the-art algorithms then
compute one or all Nash equilibria of the game.

For further information please navigate the links on the right, and
try the `Game Theory Explorer Software <http://gte.csc.liv.ac.uk/gte/>`_ !

Note that this is a |beta| ("beta") software version still under development, so
please be patient with misbehaviour and bugs.
