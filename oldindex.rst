We are applying for sponsorship by the Google Summer of Code 2015.



Welcome to the homepage for Game Theory Explorer |beta|, which is a
software tool to create and analyze games as models of strategic interaction.
An extensive or strategic-form game can be created and nicely displayed with a
graphical user interface in a web browser. State-of-the-art algorithms then
compute one or all Nash equilibria of the game.

        This will launch Game Theory Explorer in a new browser window
        where you can create and solve games; right-click if you have pop-ups blocked.

Note that this is a |beta| ("beta") software version still under development, so
please be patient with misbehaviour and bugs.
